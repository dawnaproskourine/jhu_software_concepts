    Name: Dawna Jones Proskourine
  </p>
<p>
  Position: Quantitative Strategist • AI & Macro Research • Rates & Derivatives
</p>
<p>
  Bio: I am a quantitative strategist and AI researcher focused on the intersection of macroeconomics, interest-rate markets,
  and data-driven portfolio construction. My work blends rigorous financial theory with modern machine learning to design systematic,
  regime-aware investment frameworks across rates, macro assets, and derivatives.
</p>
<p>
  With a strong foundation in quantitative finance, I specialize in interest-rate products, yield-curve modeling,
  risk measurement, and derivatives pricing, including swaptions, structured rates, and curve-based relative-value
  strategies. My approach is distinctly top-down: I start with macroeconomic regimes and policy dynamics, then translate
  those views into disciplined, statistically robust trading and risk-management models.
</p>
<p>
  I am currently pursuing advanced training in artificial intelligence, with research interests centered on applying
  machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and reinforcement learning to portfolio management and macro trading.
  My academic focus includes regime detection, adaptive allocation, nonlinear risk modeling, and the integration of
  economic structure into AI systems—bridging the gap between black-box models and financial intuition.
</p>
<p>
  Beyond research, I am deeply engaged in building practical quantitative workflows, from systematic trade scanners and
  statistical arbitrage frameworks to end-to-end portfolio analytics and risk engines. I am equally comfortable with theory,
  code, and real-world implementation, and I value models that are interpretable, robust, and economically grounded.
</p>
<p>
  At my core, I am driven by a single question: how can intelligent systems better understand macroeconomic uncertainty
  and convert it into repeatable investment decisions? I see quantitative finance not just as optimization, but as a
  dynamic dialogue between markets, models, and human judgment.
