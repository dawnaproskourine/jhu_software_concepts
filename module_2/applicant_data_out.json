However, my application status still shows “Under Program Review.”\r\nHas anyone else experienced this? Is it a system glitch, or does it usually mean a decision is coming soon? Just trying to figure out if this is normal or if I should reach out to my department.\r\nThanks for any insight!",

Several things mentioned were \"We're all suffering together,\" \"Do NOT go to professors or advisors about anything, go to peers first because the faculty will talk about you to each other behind your back and this will change their perspective of you,\" and it was also shared that although this program is supposed to be heavily focused on social justice, diversity, and multiculturalism, this is the type of program that preaches those things and does not actually adhere to them in their curriculum or program. It's marketed as scientist-practitioner, but many students shared a pressure constantly put on them to focus on their research above anything else. One student even said \"I would never choose this program in another life.\" Bottom line - even if I do get accepted I simply won't be going.",
